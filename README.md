Automating Issue Creation from SonarQube in CI/CD Pipelines (90h)
This project focuses on automating the creation of GitHub issues based on SonarQube analysis in a CI/CD pipeline. By integrating SonarQube results into the development workflow, the system will automatically detect code quality issues, create GitHub issues, and notify maintainers for quick action.

Key Features:

Automated Issue Creation: Detect new issues from SonarQube scans and create corresponding GitHub issues
Severity-Based Issue Prioritization: Categorize issues based on severity (Critical, Major, Minor)
Pipeline Integration: Ensure smooth integration with CI/CD workflows for real-time analysis
Developer Notifications: Automatically notify responsible developers about newly created issues
Customizable Rules: Allow maintainers to define which issues should trigger automatic creation
Keywords: SonarQube, Software Quality, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Automation
Expected Outcome: A fully automated issue tracking system that integrates SonarQube with GitHub for better software quality management
Skills Required: Python, JavaScript, GitHub Actions, SonarQube API
Mentor: Leticia
Difficulty: Easy
